## Introduction

Welcome to the Spring 2019 edition of Programming Language Concepts (PLC).  In this class we will study the design of programming languages.  We will largely do this through learning how to implement features from modern languages like scoped local variables, expression evaluation, and garbage collection.  We will also learn about the functional programming paradigm, where programs must behave like mathematical functions: given the same input, they must produce the same output.  While this prevents a direct treatment of implicit state (think about a function like gettimeofday(), which returns a different answer for every call), it also enables powerful reasoning principles to be applied to programs.  We will study functional programming through two advanced languages: Haskell, for the first part of the course, and Agda for the second.  Both languages are designed to facilitate writing concise code for which many properties can be checked at compile-time.  Agda goes the farthest on the latter point, allowing programmers to write proofs of logical properties of those programs, in the same language one uses to write programs.  This powerful verification capability makes it possible to write provably correct code, an exciting engineering proposition.

No prior familiarity with Haskell, Agda, or functional programming is assumed in this class, but students are expected to have passed the prerequisite classes CS:2230, CS:2210 and one of CS:2630, ECE:3330, CS:2820, or ECE:3350, all with grade at least C-.

## Course Staff

Prof. Aaron Stump, instructor.  Rentian Dong, TA.  Olivia Cook, grader.

## Course Materials and Repository

The required textbook for the course is “Programming in Haskell”, 2nd edition, by Graham Hutton.  We will also use a my book "Verified Functional Programming in Agda".  It is freely available to U. Iowa students (PDF, epub) [here](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2841316) (you might need to be on campus or on the VPN to get the download links).

We will use the distributed version-control system **git** to exchange files.  I will be using the [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) graphical interface to git in class, and since this is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, I suggest that if you are not already using other git tools, you might want to try this one.

For more about using U. Iowa's installation of github, see [here](uiowa-github-tips.md).

## Disabilities

Please contact me if you have a disability accommodation, or any related matter to discuss. 

## Collaboration Policy

For most assignments and the project, you can work with one other person (no more), if you wish.  You may also work by yourself.  You should not share code or work together on code with anyone except the course staff or your partner.  Other than these exceptions, you may not exchange solutions (e.g., by email) or work together on solutions with other students or others outside the class.  You may not get detailed help on your solution from other students or others outside the class.  Possible instances of cheating will be investigated and may be reported to the Dean's office, as required by CLAS policy.  In addition, I am offering a bounty of 50 points for information leading to the identification of any students posting class homeworks to coding-for-hire web sites.  This is an execrable violation of academic integrity that I will do my best to stamp out if it arises (as it has in past semesters).

## Course Platforms and Software

We expect most students will use Windows, and we will ensure that our assignments and courseware work on Windows.  We will be using several programs in this class, which you will probably want to download and install on your computer.  These programs will also be available on the CS lab Windows machines in 301 MacLean.  The first of these are Haskell and Emacs.  Homework 0 will get you started.

## Piazza and Course Help

We welcome you to discuss your homework with us, even if you just want to make sure you are doing it correctly!  You can come to office hours, or ask a question on [our page](https://piazza.com/the_university_of_iowa/spring2019/cs3820/home) on Piazza course-discussion web service, which we will use to field questions about the class, and make announcements.

You can ask questions on Piazza privately or publicly (and anonymously if you wish, although note that you will only be anonymous to other students, not the course staff).  We reserve the right to make private questions public and vice versa.  You will get faster help if you post on Piazza than if you email us directly.  This is because amazingly, your peers will answer your questions, usually even faster than we will!  But you are indeed welcome to email us, particularly with personal matters (illness, expected absence from class, etc.). 

We do not expect to use ICON for this class very much, except for keeping track of grades.

## Course calendar

You may find the course calendar, with homework due dates and test dates, [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=a5d6qokrert25ce093iksp8np0%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FChicago).

## Late Policy

We do not accept late homework.  Instead, we offer bonus points for turning homeworks in early.

## Graded Work and Schedule

A perfect score in this class is 1000 total points.  The plan for the graded work is [here](work.md) (dates also on the course calendar).

### Grading scale

Usually in this class, 88% and up is some kind of A, 76% and up some kind of B, 62% and up some kind of C, and 50% and up some kind of D.  Below 50% is failing (F).  The bottom three points of the range for a letter grade X give you an X-.  The top three points (or above 100%) give you an X+.  I reserve the right to change this scale as needed, but historically this is what it has been.
